The perspective of the Government has been to track penetration of banking services to (a) the unbanked segment, especially women and weaker sections of the rural demography and (b) optimum coverage of such customers in respective GPs. The collaboration just not has set institutional interface, rather, did open an option for respective technologies to integrate and revisit outcome-led performance parameters from the angle of low-ticket banking businesses.
