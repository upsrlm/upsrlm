            Centrality of the program-monitoring has been two overlapping aspects _ Operational progress and BC Sakhi Performance. A chain of processes tracked on real-time helped high-frequency monitoring. BC Sakhi performances tracked around few input-pointers _ no. of working days, no. txn. conducted for each working-days and type of banking products. These provided a clear picture of txn. volumes on weekly & monthly basis and consequently the BC Commission generated to support BC Sakhi business. This approach to monitoring has been typical and predictable.

            The other pointers following the suit of functional capacity of the BC Sakhi on digital devices are e.g constant feedback on screen- & pageviews of the digital apps, helped the Govt. understand pace of penetration of technology and suitability thereof. User-behaviour through the digital transactions provided keen insights on the program dynamics on the ground.
